# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
This Prework Study Guide is designed to help users navigate through essential web development topics, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each section contains concise notes and examples, making it easier to review and understand the core concepts of each subject. By opening the DevTools console, users can interact with JavaScript code, which will list topics learned during the prework and recommend the next subject to focus on. The motivation behind this project was to create an interactive tool that aids learners in organizing their study materials, providing a hands-on experience while reinforcing their learning. It solves the problem of having fragmented resources by consolidating key topics into one guide. Through building this project, I learned how to structure educational content in an engaging, user-friendly format while utilizing JavaScript to create an interactive study experience.
